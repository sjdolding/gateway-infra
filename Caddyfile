# Base Caddyfile for Gateway
#
# Purpose:
#   Import all site configuration snippets from sites-enabled/
#
# Site-specific routing is defined in project Caddy snippets:
#   /srv/projects/<project>/deploy/caddy-sites/<hostname>.caddy
#
# Those snippets are symlinked to sites-enabled/ by enable-site.sh

# Global options (optional)
{
	# Uncomment to enable admin API on localhost only
	# admin localhost:2019
	
	# Automatic HTTPS is enabled by default (no need to specify)
}

# Import all enabled sites
import /etc/caddy/sites-enabled/*
